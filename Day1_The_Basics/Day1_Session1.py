#  Introduction

# <markdowncell>

# * Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. 
# * There are no type declarations of variables, parameters. 
# * code is short and flexible
# * Created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum
# * Named after Monty Python
# * Open sourced from the beginning
# * Initially considered a scripting language, but it is much more than that..
# * Scalable, object oriented and functional from the beginning
# * Used by Google from the beginning

# Use cases of python

# <markdowncell>

# * Scientific Computing
# * Rapid prototyping
# * Web Development
# * Test Automation
# * System Programming
# * Cloud Computing

# Comparison with other languages

# <markdowncell>

# * Difference with Statically typed languages
# * No pre compilation step.
# * Friendly Syntax - no braces, no semi colons.

# The first program!

# <markdowncell>

# * open a text editor
# * Enter "print 'Hello World!'"
# * save as 'first_program.py'
# * Open console, change location to the folder where this file is saved.
# * python first_program.py
# * Congratulations!
# 
# ```python
# print
# ```
# This statement will print things to console
# 
# ```python
# 'Hello World' was a string
# ```
# 
# You can comment a line by starting it with `#`
# The statement will not be executed
# 
# ```python
# # This is a python comment
# # Each comment will be of one line
# # If you need multi line comments, triple quoted strings can be used
# # Although strictly speaking triple quoted strings are strings and not comments
# # we will discuss more about triple quoted strings later
# ```
