      " - Functions are first class (objects). That is, everything you can do with \"data\" can be done with functions themselves (such as passing a function to another function). \n",
      " - Recursion is used as a primary control structure. \n",
      " - With Python 2.0, a very nice bit of \"syntactic sugar\" was added with list comprehensions.\n",
      " - While list comprehensions add no new capability, they make a lot of the old capabilities look a lot nicer. \n",
      " - The basic elements of FP in Python are the functions map(), reduce(), and filter(), and the operator lambda.\n",
      " - These very few functions (and the basic operators) are almost sufficient to write any Python program.\n",
      " - specifically, the flow control statements (if, elif, else, assert, try, except, finally, for, break, continue, while, def) can all be handled in a functional style using exclusively the FP functions and operators."
